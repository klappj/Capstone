# This script is going to try to predict the next word given the previous 3
# with luck, it will also be able to do some prediction as you type
# but that is black magic.

# this is the placeholder to load files
# onegram
# twogram
# trigram
# fourgram

# Start with 3 word string, try to find that word in fourgram
# ... 

# find that string in the 3 gram to find n for denominator of odds

# find the last 2 words in 3 gram

# find the middle word to find n for denominator of oddds

# find last word in dictionary

# shit ... the onegrams have been snipped, so I might have to build a dictionary

# that wasn't the intent, but it makes things faster, 
# and the ngrams are very, very slow to build from the short corpus

# given the odds, this function should return next word guesses in order


# the next function should, given the list of guesses, and the letters the 
# input is givng as typing, do a predictive typing. 
# this might require building my own dictionary again, before the text was 
# cleaned ... that would give word frequencies. Other thought is to just
# find a dictionary somewhere else.
